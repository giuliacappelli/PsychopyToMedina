# PsychoPy-To-Medina converter (+ filter and anonymizer)
This quick-and-dirty (fairly quick, horribly dirty) script converts the output of PsychoPy experiments to input for my script to create a Medina (2007)-style Stochastic OT model. I wrote this program for the purposes of my PhD thesis about a StOT model of object drop, but it can easily be adapted to your needs.

## Getting started
The script should run on Python 3 and does not have to be installed. Runs fine on Python 3.9.4 in Ubuntu 21.04.

### Prerequisites
You need the following packages to make the script work:
    argparse
    collections
    pandas
    numpy
    warnings (optional)
    
To install these packages in Python 3, make sure you have installed pip3 and run:
    pip3 install <package>

## Running the script
Make sure you have the script and the input files within the same folder before starting.
